## Hey there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Juan Camilo, a Software Systems Engineering student at ICESI University.  
I don't have much to say. I'm just a guy who likes videogames and software development.  
I like to develop web applications, videogames, and AI, or a mix of those.  
So I really like to challenge myself :)
